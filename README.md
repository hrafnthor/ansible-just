# Ansible Just

An opinionated role that installs [Just](https://just.systems)

## Requirements

This role requires two separate collections be installed.

First it requires the `ansible.utils` collection be installed from Ansible-Galaxy via:

```shell
ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.utils
```

Secondly it requires the `community.general` collection to be installed from Ansible-Galaxy via:

```shell
ansible-galaxy collection install community.general
```

It then also requires the `jsonschema` Python package be installed via:

```shell
pip3 install jsonschema
```

## Role Variables

All variables are optional unless otherwise marked as required.

```yaml
just:
  remove:     [bool]          Indicates if just should be removed
  trim:       [bool]          Indicates if non default versions should be removed
  default:    [string]        The version that should be set as default
  versions:   [string array]  A list of versions that should be installed
  completions:
    bash:     [string array]  A list of all users that should have bash completions added
    zsh:      [string array]  A list of all users that should have zsh completions added
    ohmyzsh:  [string array]  A list of all users that should have ohmyzsh completions added

`just` : [mapping] (required) contains the following fields:

* `versions` : [array of strings] (optional)

    A list of valid Just versions that should be fetched and extracted to `just_path`.

* `default` : [string] (optional)

    The version that should be set as system default. If the version does not exist the task will fail.

* `trim`: [boolean] (optional)

    If true indicates that all non linked directories under `just_path` that do not correspond to version numbers defined inside `versions` should be removed.

### Defaults

`just_default_path` : [string] (optional) The path at which `Just` will be extracted to. Defaults to `/opt/just`

`just_default_zsh_completion_path` : [string] (optional) The at which auto completion file will be generated for `zsh`. Is always relative to a user's home directory. Defaults to `.local/share/zsh/completions`

`just_default_ohmyzsh_completion_path` : [string] (optional) The at which auto completion file will be generated for `ohmyzsh`. Is always relative to a user's home directory. Defaults to `.oh-my-zsh/completions`

Example:

```yaml

  remove: false
  trim: true
  default: "1.1.1"
  versions:
    - "1.1.1"
    - "1.2.2"
  completions:
    bash:
      - odinn
    zsh:
      - loki
    ohmyzsh:
      - loki
      - thor
 ```


## Dependencies

None, other then previously stated requirements.

## Setup

Before the role can be used it needs to be added to the machine running the playbook, and as of writing this, this role is not hosted on Ansible-Galaxy only on Github.

1. Create a `requirements.yml` file in the root directory of the playbook being worked on.

2. Add the following definition inside the `requirements.yml` file:

```yml
- name: hth-just
  src: https://github.com/hrafnthor/ansible-just.git
  scm: git
```

3. Install the requirements by executing

```shell
ansible-galaxy install -r .requirements.yml
```

This will allow any playbook run from this machine to use the role `hth-just`


## Example Playbook


```yaml
- hosts: all
    vars:
    - just:

        - "1.1.1"
        - "1.2.2"
        completions:
          bash:
            - odinn
